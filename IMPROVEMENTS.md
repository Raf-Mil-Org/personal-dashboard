# Project Improvements & Suggestions

Below are some ideas and suggestions to further enhance the Sakai Health Dashboard project:

## UI/UX Improvements

-   **Componentization:**
    -   Refactor large sections (e.g., Water Intake, Supplements, Medication, etc.) into smaller, reusable Vue components for better maintainability and scalability.
-   **Dynamic Dashboard Layout:**
    -   Implement a drag-and-drop grid system (e.g., using vue-grid-layout) so users can customize their dashboard layout.
-   **Accessibility:**
    -   Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast).
-   **Mobile Optimization:**
    -   Test and optimize the dashboard for mobile devices, ensuring touch targets and layouts are user-friendly.
-   **Data Visualization:**
    -   Add charts/graphs for trends (e.g., water intake over time, sleep quality trends, mood history).
-   **User Feedback:**
    -   Add notifications or toasts for actions (e.g., “Entry saved”, “Error occurred”).

## Backend & Data Handling

-   **API Structure:**
    -   Consider a RESTful or GraphQL API for better scalability and integration with other apps.
-   **Authentication & Security:**
    -   Implement robust authentication and ensure user data is protected, especially for public deployments.
-   **Data Validation:**
    -   Add validation both on the frontend and backend to prevent invalid data entries.
-   **Sync & Offline Support:**
    -   Consider local storage or service workers for offline use, syncing when online.

## General Improvements

-   **Testing:**
    -   Add unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   Expand the README with setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
-   **Performance:**
    -   Profile for performance bottlenecks, especially as data grows.
-   **User Customization:**
    -   Allow users to define custom health metrics or cards.
-   **Internationalization (i18n):**
    -   Add support for multiple languages.
